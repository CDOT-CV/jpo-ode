JPO-ODE Release Notes
----------------------------

Version 4.0.0, released January 2025
----------------------------------------
### **Summary**

The jpo-ode 4.0.0 release brings a variety of updates aimed at enhancing functionality, maintainability, and overall development experience.

Key highlights include:
- The introduction of a generated TMC TIM Topic
- The migration from a custom Kafka client to Spring Kafka for improved Spring integration
- Updates to TIM schemas and JSON annotations for more J2735-accurate ODE processing

Significant strides have been made in optimizing configurations through enhancements like the extraction of Kafka properties,
environment variables, and Kafka topics into more streamlined Spring Configuration properties.

Schema updates have been implemented to increment the version of output messages and provide partial compatibility with 
J2735 2024. However, some limitations remain. Due to a bug in the ASN.1 Compiler, the VehicleEventFlags bitstring has 
been reverted to its 2020 version, excluding the eventJackKnife bit introduced in the 2024 revision. As a result, this 
bit will not appear in output BSMs until the issue is resolved. Additional fields added to BSM-related 
structures in J2735 2024 are not yet supported in the ODE. These fields will be incorporated in a future release.

Developer-focused changes include revisions to the README, Makefile, and devcontainer to support smoother onboarding and
ease of use. Other vital updates encompass new entries in the submodule compatibility guide, version upgrades, and
bug fixes related to Kafka configurations and message handling.

Version 3.0.0, released September 2024
----------------------------------------
### **Summary**
The updates for the jpo-ode 3.0.0 release include several key improvements and cleanups. Outdated 'deposit over WebSocket to SDX' code was removed and the ppm_tim service was eliminated from Docker compose files. Additionally, the jpo-s3-deposit submodule was replaced with the jpo-utils submodule. Error handling was enhanced, particularly in interpreting "SNMP Error Code 10" from RSUs and stack traces for bad encoded data from ACM are now printed only when debug logging is enabled. Documentation updates provide more granular project references and mapfile references in ppm*.properties files were updated. Build and deployment improvements include resolving a UID conflict for container builds and adding Maven JAR publishing to GitHub Maven Central via GitHub Actions. Lastly, a Docker startup script was introduced for log offloading via SSH/SCP and source ASN1 bytes payload support was added for IMP depositors.
