# Data Flow Diagrams
The purpose of these diagrams is to show:
- how data flows through the Operation Data Environment (both in an overall sense and for each message type)
- how the ODE interacts with kafka topics as well as its submodules.

## Key Explanation
- The blue rectangles are java classes that belong to this repository.
- The yellow ovals are kafka topics that the ODE and its submodules consume from and produce to.
- The red rectangles are groups of java classes.
- The red ovals are groups of kafka topics.
- The green rectangles are submodules of the ODE.
- The arrows indicate the data flow. The beginning of the arrow is where it flows from and the end of the arrow is where it flows to.

## Data Flow Explanations
### Overview Data Flow 1 (Tim Depositor Controller)
1. Messages come in through the TimDepositorController class and are pushed to the Broadcast Messages and Json Messages groups of topics, as well as the AsnEncoderInput topic.
1. The [ACM](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/asn1_codec) pulls from the Asn1EncoderInput and pushes encoded messages to the Asn1EncoderOutput topic.
1. The AsnEncodedDataRouter class pulls from the Asn1EncoderOutput topic and pushes it to the AsnCommandManager class.
1. If the message is not signed, it is sent to the SignatureController class to be signed.
1. If the message is signed and meant for the RSU, it will be passed to the RsuDepositor class which sends the message to the RSUs.
1. If the message is signed, is meant for the SDX and the message has not been double-encoded, yet, it will be sent back to the Asn1EncoderInput topic for encoding.
1. If the message is signed, is meant for the SDX and the message has been double-encoded, it will be passed to the SDWDepositorInput, pulled into the [SDWD](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-sdw-depositor) and sent to the SDX.
1. The [PPM](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-cvdp) pulls from the Json Messages group of topics and sends filtered messages to the Filtered Json Messages group of topics.
1. The [GeoJSON Converter](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter) pulls from the Json Messages group of topics, converts the messages and pushes them to the Processed Spat/Map group of topics.
1. The [Conflict Monitor](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-conflictmonitor) pulls from the Processed Map/Spat group of topics and pushes to the [Conflict Monitor](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-conflictmonitor) Output Topics group.

### Overview Data Flow 2 (Receiver Classes)
